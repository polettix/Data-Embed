=head1 NAME

Data::Embed::File - embed arbitrary data in a file

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Accessor class for representing an embedded file (for reading).

=head1 METHODS

=head2 B<< new >>

Constructor. It will act lazily, just storing the input data for later
usage by other methods, providing validation.

Input data can be provided as key-value pairs of through a reference to
a hash.

For proper functioning of the object, the following keys should be
provided:

=over

=item C<< fh >>

a filehandle for the stream where the data are contained

=item C<< filename >>

the name of the file where the data are. This parameter is optional if
C<fh> above is already provided.

=item C<< offset >>

the offset within the stream where the real data for this file begins.
C<0> means the very beginning of the file.

=item C<< length >>

the length of the data belonging to this C<File>.

=back


=head2 B<< fh >>

Get a filehandle suitable for accessing the embedded file. It provides
back a filehandle through L<IO::Slice>, providing the illusion of
working on a file per-se instead of a slice inside a bigger file.

=head2 B<< contents >>

Convenience method to slurp the whole contents of the embedded file in
one single shot. It always provides the full contents, independently of
whether data had been read before, although it restores the filehandle
to the previous position.

=head2 B<< name >>

Get the name associated to the file, whatever it is.
L<Data::Embed::Reader> sets it from what is read in the index file
